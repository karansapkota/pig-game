# Pig Game

## Overview

A simple dice game designed for two players. The goal is to reach 50 points first. Players take turns rolling a die and can roll as many times as they like during their turn. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they've accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends. The key is deciding when to stop rolling and secure your points by holding.
