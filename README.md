# Pig Game

## Overview

The Pig Game is a simple dice game designed for two players. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a die and can roll as many times as they like during their turn. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they've accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends. The key is deciding when to stop rolling and secure your points by holding.

## Rules

1. Two players take turns rolling a die.
2. On each turn, a player can roll as many times as they wish.
3. The result of each roll is added to the current turn's score.
4. Rolling a 1 results in losing all points for that turn, and the turn passes to the next player.
5. Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, adding it to their total and ending their turn.
6. The first player to reach 100 points wins.
